# Document Scanner Script

This Python script implements an automatic document scanning and perspective transformation process to simulate a scanned effect for an image containing a document. The script utilizes several image processing techniques, including edge detection, contour detection, and perspective warping to extract and enhance the document from an image.

## Requirements

To run this script, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `imutils`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python imutils matplotlib scikit-image
```

Description
Key Steps
Image Processing:

The input image is read from a file path (paper.jpg) and resized to a manageable height for further processing.
The image is converted to grayscale and blurred to reduce noise and improve edge detection.
The Canny edge detector is applied to highlight edges in the image.
Contour Detection:

The script detects contours in the edge map and sorts them by area, selecting the top 5 largest contours.
It then loops through the contours to find a quadrilateral contour, which likely represents the document in the image.
Perspective Transformation:

Once the document contour is found, the script uses the cv2.getPerspectiveTransform function to apply a perspective transformation, simulating the effect of viewing the document from the top.
Thresholding:

The warped image (perspective-corrected document) is then thresholded to simulate a scanned effect, using adaptive thresholding from scikit-image.
Display Output:

The original image and the transformed image (with the "scanned" effect) are displayed side by side.
